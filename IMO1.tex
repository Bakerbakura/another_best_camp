\item %IMO 2016 C1
	The leader of an IMO team chooses positive integers $n$ and $k$ with $n>k$, and announces them to the deputy leader and a contestant. The leader then secretly tells the deputy leader an $n$-digit binary string, and the deputy leader writes down all $n$-digit binary strings which differ from the leader's in exactly $k$ positions. (For example, if $n=3$ and $k=1$, and if the leader chooses 101, the deupty leader would write down 001, 111 and 100.) The contestant is allowed to look at the strings written by the deputy leader and guess the leader's string. What is the minimum number of guesses (in terms of $n$ and $k$) needed to guarantee the correct answer?

\item %IMO 2016 G2
	Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$ and incentre $I$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the side $BC$. Denote by $D$ the foot of the perpendicular from $I$ to side $BC$. The line through $I$ perpendicular to $AI$ meets sides $AB$ and $AC$ at $F$ and $E$ respectively. Suppose the circumcircle of triangle $AEF$ intersects $\Gamma$ at a point $X$ other than $A$. Prove that the lines $XD$ and $AM$ meet on $\Gamma$.

\item %IMO 2016 A4
	Denote by $\mathbb{R}^+$ the set of all positive real numbers. Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R}^+\to\mathbb{R}^+$ such that \[xf(x^2)f(f(y)) +f(yf(x)) =f(xy)\left(f(f(x^2))+f(f(y^2))\right)\] for all positive real numbers $x$ and $y$.
